Just copy this file anywhere to a model folder and run 'cryengine_send_test_models' to copy the models to the testing folder in the cryengine game directory.  You will recieve an error unless you change your cryengine game directory in 'configuration.py'

This file will persist in the model folder until the draft model is recieved using 'cryengine_retrieve_test_models.py'.
